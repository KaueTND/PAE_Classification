# Improving Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Classification using Data Augmentation in 3D Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the code and results from our research on using data augmentation to improve the classification of **Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE)** in medical imaging, specifically using **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. In this study, we investigated the effects of different rates of data augmentation on model performance and generalizability.
